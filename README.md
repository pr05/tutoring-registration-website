# tutoring-registration-website

This website provides tools to register students and tutors for tutoring services and to manage these services. The website replaces the former manual registration system that was in place in order to increase efficiency and bring tutoring services to a larger group of people. It also addresses physical space limitations and overbooking, which was a frequent issue under the manual mangement system.

This website consists of 3 account types:
  1. Administrator accounts - able to manage other user account types as well as registration session information.
  2. Tutor accounts - able to create classes in time slots predefined by the administrator account based on the tutor's availability.
  3. Student accounts - able to register for available classes with tutors.
